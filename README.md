Format
------

This course will **focus heavily on in-class participation** in
addition to assigned readings from scholarly journals, presentations
from guest speakers, several "feedback" assignments, and weekly blog
articles in addition to regular practice with the software tools
listed in the description.

Your persistent cooperation in group work and contributions to the
course will culminate into a collaborative term project. The format
will be interactive and will involve your questions, opinions, and
participation.

Topics Covered Will Include:

- Reproducibility and Collaboration
- Computational Architecture
- Data structures and formats
- Content v. Presentation; Web standards
- Simulation
- Numerics
- Numerical linear algebra
- Optimization
- Data Visualization
- Code efficiency


Specific Objectives
--------------------

This is not a traditional course, and you will not be able to cram and
succeed in this course. The instructors and GSIs want you to succeed.
Ask for help when you need it, and before you become desperate.


Grading
-------

- Lecture Attendance/Participation
- Homework Assignments
- Weekly Reflections
- Collaborative Term Project

We will discuss each assignment in greater detail in lecture.


Additional Notes
----------------

Guest Speakers: **Participation is mandatory.** When a guest lecturer
is scheduled to speak you cannot miss the class without contacting the
instructor or GSI and scheduling a meeting to justify your absence.

Absences at other times: **Communication is key.** The success of the
group depends on the cooperation of its members. You will be held
responsible for communicating absences to your group members in
addition to the instructor and the GSI.

Electronic Gadgets: **Silenced or Off.**
