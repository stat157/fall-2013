2013-09-03: In-class participation
==================================

Objective
---------

By the end of class today you will have:

- Learned how to ask for help by:

  + Identifying roadblocks

  + Announcing your struggles *early*

  + Considering the options

  + Trying to solve the problem

  + Asking for help if the options you've tried didn't work

  Here is a really great real-life example from this weekend:

  1. Places I got stuck: /join #stat157 and say hello to everyone. Can't create new virtual machine

  2. Confusing: I'm not accustomed to computer language, especially
  not familiar with the programs we are using. I don't understand
  when it just says do something in three words. I need descriptions
  on where to click, what to type etc...??

  3. I tried https://www.google.com/#q=how+to+setup+pidgin, but the
  links did not links did not help me with the specific tasks. I
  just searched the links you posted, which helped me set up my
  account but still unable to join stat157. I don't know #join
  stat157 is joint a chat or what? I tried click join a chat, and
  other options but all didn't work.

- Assembled into facilitated breakout groups to:

  + Review the tasks and homework assignment from last week to make sure
    everyone in the class is on the same page.

  + Fully document the installation and configuration process so that
    it is reproducible by others.

- Provided feedback to your instructors about the assignment:

    - Did you know what to do?

    - Did you understand what was expected of you?

    - Were the instructions clear and complete? What about the
      instructions were confusing?

    - Did you figure out what to do despite any missing steps? What
      methods did you try to solve the problem on your own?

- Learned about the importance of security, unintended consequences,
  and interacting with the real world-- which is sometimes an
  unwelcoming and hostile place! Let's work together to ensure that
  our machines, our data, and our selves stay safe!

- An Ubuntu-based virtual machine running the IPython Notebook

- Your first Python program running in the IPython Notebook
